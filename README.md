# JabRef 4 VSCode

JabRef 4 VSCode brings the support for using JabRefs features like integrity and consistency checks and more to your VSCode environment! 

## Features

You can use JabRef's [integrity](https://docs.jabref.org/finding-sorting-and-cleaning-entries/checkintegrity) and [consistency](https://docs.jabref.org/finding-sorting-and-cleaning-entries/checkconsistency) checks right in your VSCode environment when working with `.bib` or `.bibtex` files.
Both options can be enabled or disabled separately in the VSCode extension settings. 

## How to test this extension

Currently, you need to clone this repository, run `npm install`, `npm run build` and open the repo in VSCode, after that you can use VSCodes' run and debug capability to run a VSCode instance with the plugin installed.

Alternatively, you can download pre-build binaries:
